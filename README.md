# Waking

A multiplayer 2D game built with Phaser 3, React, TypeScript, and Socket.IO.

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This installs dependencies for both client and server workspaces.

### 2. Run Development Servers

```bash
npm run dev
```

This runs both the server (port 3001) and client (port 3000) concurrently.

Alternatively, run them separately:

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Server
npm run dev:server

# Terminal 2 - Client
npm run dev:client
```

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```
